# blob

## Overview

The goal of blob is to provide a simple S3 class to represent a vector of binary objects, aka blobs. The `blob` class is a lightweight wrapper around a list of raw vectors, suitable for inclusion in a data frame.

In most cases you will not need to use this package explicitly: it will be used transparently by packages that need to load BLOB columns from databases or binary file formats.

## Installation

```r
# The easiest way to get blob is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just blob:
install.packages("blob")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidyverse/blob")
```

## Example

To create a blob, use `blob()`, `new_blob()` or `as_blob()`:

```{r example}
library(blob)

x1 <- charToRaw("Good morning")
x2 <- as.raw(c(0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f))

new_blob(list(x1, x2))
blob(x1, x2)

as_blob(c("Good morning", "Good evening"))
```
